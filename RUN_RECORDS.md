### Remarks

Actually went really smooth this time. Flatpaks and cargo installs take a really long time, but that was still 10 minutes or so. The reboot in the VM takes a really long time so certainly lost time there. Then there is the extension installation which just takes a bit of time and keeps shifting focus of the tab. Signing in to vscode opens LibreOffice Writer (WTF?!). Extension installation finally now is a good experience.

### Possible improvements

- ~~Open instructions in new window so it does not lose focus when settings up addons~~
- ~~Shorten reboot time~~
- ~~Preset `ANSIBLE_PASSWORD`~~
- ~~See if `gext` has a way to disable confirmation~~: not possible, see [issue](https://github.com/essembeh/gnome-extensions-cli/issues/13#issuecomment-1529160849)
- ~~Add instruction to explicitly sync Atuin~~
- ~~Check logins of the sites and maybe have priorities?~~: cleaned up logins, can't have priorities.
