# Dotfiles / Installation Manager

We should make Chezmoi the entry point as it can also be used to run scripts.

What to install:
1. Aqua
2. Mise
3. Ansible is a good one, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RkANM9FfTM

> How to install Aqua?

We can run the installer script with Chezmoi after copying everything over with `run_once_after_[name]`. Our shell config file should already contain the Aqua paths, so that everything is configured

export GITHUB_TOKEN before running

> How to install mise?


## Experimenting with Incus:

1. Install incus
2. Install `virt-manager`
3.


NOTE: scripts are not ran in parallel so dependencies can be built.
